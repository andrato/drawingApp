Web application that is meant for both beginners in digital drawing as well as people who are passionate about drawing or have more experience. 
The application has a drawing module which can be used for free. The users can also view the drawings that are published and have access to their recordings. This provides a better understanding of the techniques that were used. The users can also add comments and vote the drawings.

The backend was developed using microservices. The communication with the client side is done through an API Gateway.
